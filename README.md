Cringemeter is a module for node.js that determine the level of cringeworthiness of a given string of text. The score is calculated on a scale from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating low cringeworthiness and 1 indicating high cringeworthiness. The score is based on factors such as the use of certain words or phrases that are commonly associated with cringeworthy content. The higher the score, the more likely the text is considered to be cringeworthy.

        message.delete();
        message.channel.send(`Don't be cringe <@${message.author.id}>!`);
